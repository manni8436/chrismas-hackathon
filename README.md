[Here is a link to the final project](https://manni8436.github.io/chrismas-hackathon/)

## INITIAL DESIGN
* The initial idea behind this project was to create a advent calendar style website, where the user 
would have to solve a code related challenge in which they would receive a special reward upon successful 
completion of the challenge.

* The main features that have been included are:
    * Easy to navigate the page.
    * Easy to read information.
    * A christmas related colour scheme that stands out, but not overwhelming.

## USER EXPERIENCE
The structure of the site was designed to be simple, easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not to leave them lost of needing more information in what to do.

* The website is for the following user types:
   
    * Users that have basic knowledge of coding, who are looking to try new things.
    * Users with advanced knowledge of coding and looking for a challenge.
    * Users with beyond advanved knowledge of coding who are looking for something fun to do.

## USER STORIES

#### CLIENT GOALS
* The site needs to be easily accessible.
* The site needs to be simple to use on several devices including desktop, tablet and mobile.
* The site should be informative and all the text should be easy to read.
* The images should be clear and not stretched or squashed.

#### FIRST TIME VISITORS
* The site to be easy to understand and self explanatory.
* The site content to be easily read and understandble.

#### RETURNING USER
* To recommend the site to friends and family.
* To come back every year to see and try new challenges.

## DESIGN

### COLOR SCHEME
This overall color scheme used throughout the site was the variety of colours in the image below.

![Site Color Scheme](assets/images/colour-scheme.png)

This color theme was used to represent slightly off traditional christmas colors, which is world wide know to be green and red,
with hint of yellow and white for text on the site to stand out.
