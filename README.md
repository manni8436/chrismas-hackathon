[Here is a link to the final project](https://manni8436.github.io/hackvent-calendar/)

## INITIAL DESIGN
* The initial idea behind this project was to create a advent calendar style website, where the user 
would have to solve a code related challenge in which they would receive a special reward upon successful 
completion of the challenge.

* The main features that have been included are:
    * Easy to navigate the page.
    * Easy to read information.
    * A christmas related colour scheme that stands out, but not overwhelming.

## USER EXPERIENCE
The structure of the site was designed to be simple, easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not to leave them lost of needing more information in what to do.

* The website is for the following user types:
   
    * Users that have basic knowledge of coding, who are looking to try new things.
    * Users with advanced knowledge of coding and looking for a challenge.
    * Users with beyond advanved knowledge of coding who are looking for something fun to do.

## DESIGN

### COLOR SCHEME
This overall color scheme used throughout the site was the variety of colours in the image below.

![Site Color Scheme](documentation/design/colour-scheme.png)

This color theme was used to represent slightly off traditional christmas colors, which is world wide know to be green and red,
with hint.

1. Persian Plum Color (#621622) *was chosen as a background color to create nice contrast with the rest of the content.*
1. Blue Green Color Wheel (#285B52) *was chosen for the doors of the challenges to create the contrast with the background image and to guide the user to click on a door challenge.*
1. Keppel Color (#58B69B) *was chosen as a background of the last door reward to emphasis that the user finished all challenges.*
1. Ghost White Color(#F2F3F8) *was chosen as a primary text color to increase readability.*
1. Saffron Color (#F8C51F) *was chosen as an accent color to make the name of the website and the name of the team more noticeable.*

* ### FONT FAMILY

![LoRes Font Family](documentation/design/font_lores.png)

## BUGS

### BUGS FOUND

1. While creating the footer, the bug below was found on the firefox browser where the footer github image links would sit horizontal on the page instead of vertical.

![Footer Bug](documentation/bugs/horizontal-footer-bug.png)

2. A horizontal overflow was found after the footer was created.

![Footer Bug](documentation/bugs/footer-horizontal-overflow.png)

3. While working on the code window, it would overflow the screen height and couldn't be scrolled, leading to parts of the interface being inaccessible.

![Code Window Bug](documentation/bugs/code-window-bug.png)

### SOLVED BUGS

1. In the `footer`, the width value was changed from `100vw` to `100%` and also in the `links-holder` class selector the `max-width`
was changed from `80%` to `80vw` and added `padding-left: 0;` and the results are shown below.

![Solved Footer Bug](documentation/bugs/solved-footer-bug.png)

2. To resolve this issue, `width: 100vw;` was removed from the `footer` selector.

![Solved Footer Horizontal Overflow Bug](documentation/bugs/solved-footer-horizontal-overflow.png)

3. In order to fix the code window bug, two additions were made in `body.code`, `max-height: 70vh;` and `overflow-y: auto;` was added.
